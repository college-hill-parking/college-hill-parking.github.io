        <div style="margin-top: 10px">
          <p>
            This project was created as part of an
            <strong>English 402</strong> class to brainstorm ways to help people
            navigate College Hill parking, which has long been a challenge in
            Pullman. Many visitors receive tickets for unknowingly parking in
            restricted zones. With fines increasing, it's a costly mistake.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our idea was to build this website to make parking rules clearer and
            help visitors more easily find legal spots, especially during WSU
            <strong>gamedays</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            As our class project ends, we hope future students or community
            members can expand on what we've created. The project is
            <strong>open source</strong> and hosted on GitHub:
            <a
              href="https://github.com/college-hill-parking/college-hill-parking.github.io.git"
              target="_blank"
            >
              View Repository </a
            >. Instructions are available on GitHub for forking the repo or
            exploring the codebase.
          </p>
          <p>
            The maps on this site were created using
            <strong>Google My Maps</strong>, and they can be copied and modified
            for future use.
          </p>
